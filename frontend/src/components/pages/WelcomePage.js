          <Typography>Hello and welcome to my website!
          My name is Aleksi Heikkil√§ and I am a student in the Metropolia school of applied sciences.
          I am currently finishing my final year of studies in
          &apos;Information and Communication Technology, Bachelor&apos;s Degree&apos;.
          On this webpage you can find a listing of my completed courses and projects.
          I have also included links to my Github/Gitlab, CV and an example API I have made for the list of my courses.
          I have created this website using React.js and the Material-ui framework.</Typography>
          <br />
          <Typography variant='h4'>Info about me</Typography>
          <Typography>I am a 24-year old programmer from Helsinki, Finland. In addition to programming,
          I enjoy watching movies, playing video games and hanging out with my friends.</Typography>
          <br />
          <Typography variant='h4'>Skills</Typography>
          <Typography>
            I am skilled in a multitude of things, some of which include different programming languages, databases and software.
            I have had the most practice in Java, SQL, Html, CSS and JavaScript. During my studies I have also used C/C++/C# and PHP.
          </Typography>
          <br />
          <Typography>
            On the software front, I have experience with several IDE&apos;s such as Eclipse, Visual Studio and NetBeans.
            I am also very experienced in the use of the Windows operating system.
            I have dabbled in the use of Linux as well.
            I have probably used Git in every project I have been part of to date.
            When using Git I always try to use descriptive commit messages to help with the understanding of my code.
          </Typography>
          <br />
          <Typography>
            Because of my frequent use of computers in my free time, my problem-solving skills have also improved considerably during the years.
            Googling solutions to all kinds of problems is a daily occurrence to me and I almost always find what is needed.
          </Typography>
          <br />
          <Typography>
            Unrelated to programming, I can use the following languages in order from best to worst: Finnish &gt; English &gt; Swedish &gt; German.
          </Typography>
          <br />
          <Typography>
            My social skills are pretty good in my opinion, and I have plenty of experience in working with groups because of several school group projects.
            I have been described as friendly and easily approachable and I always enjoy meeting new people.
            I usually prefer working in groups, but working alone is not foreign to me.
